Context may also include unintended, downstream, off-label, or other unforeseen scopes of application.\n\nA fundamental step to mapping context is having a broad and appropriate set of skills and perspectives at the table. Within an organization this means team composition- demographic, disciplinary, experiential- that can enhance creativity and the consideration of risks. Organizational management should recognize the importance of diversity beyond its business case. By providing license for all team members to freely engage in critical inquiry, management can work to ensure that pervasive institutional biases are not inadvertently squashing creativity. This commitment to diverse and inclusive teaming increases the ability of an organization to broaden their contextual perspectives, check their assumptions about context of use, recognize when systems are not functional within and out of the intended context, and identify constraints in real world applications that may lead to harmful impacts.\n\n\n\nWhere might I go to learn more?\n\n\n\nFor more information about:\n\nSocio-technical systems    \nAndrew D.
