NIST would value your feedback about the approach and content of the preliminary AI Risk Management Framework (AI RMF) Playbook. The Playbook complements the AI RMF by providing additional explanations and guidance about the functions, categories, and subcategories with a focus on recommended actions Framework users could take to incorporate trustworthiness considerations in the design, development and use of AI systems.

<p>
The current draft version is based on the first draft of the AI RMF. It will be revised to match the second draft of the Framework after commenters provide their suggestions about the Playbook. This early draft of the Playbook only addresses “ Map” and “Govern” – two of the proposed  four functions  in the AI RMFthe first draft of the AI RMF.  Draft material for the other two functions, “Measure” and “Manage,” will be released at a later date.

The AI RMF and the Playbook are intended for voluntary use.

This draft version of the portion of the Playbook is being released early to ensure that the community has an opportunity to provide comments and contribute to the eventual first full version of the Playbook, to be released in January 2023. The Playbook will be hosted temporarily on GitHub Pages.
