## AI Actors ##

Setting in which the AI system will be deployed, the specific set of users along with their expectations, and impacts of system use are understood and documented as appropriate.

<details>
<summary>What is this about?</summary>

Context includes the intended and actual setting in which it is deployed, the specific set of users, operators or subjects along with their expectations, concept of operations, intended purposes and impacts of system use, the necessary requirements to ensure the system can be optimally deployed and operated, potential negative impacts to individuals, groups, communities, organizations, and society and any other system or context specifications, or legal requirements, or impacts to the environment. Context may also include unintended, downstream, off-label, or other unforeseen scopes of application.

A fundamental step to mapping context is having a broad and appropriate set of skills and perspectives at the table. Within an organization this means team composition- demographic, disciplinary, experiential- that can enhance creativity and the consideration of risks. Organizational management should recognize the importance of diversity beyond its business case. By providing license for all team members to freely engage in critical inquiry, management can work to ensure that pervasive institutional biases are not inadvertently squashing creativity. This commitment to diverse and inclusive teaming increases the ability of an organization to broaden their contextual perspectives, check their assumptions about context of use, recognize when systems are not functional within and out of the intended context, and identify constraints in real world applications that may lead to harmful impacts.

<summary>What steps can be taken to implement this?</summary>
  <ul>
  <li> Plan and document the composition of AI design and development teams to reflect inter-disciplinary roles, competencies, skills and capacity for AI efforts; and ensure that team membership incorporates demographic diversity and broad domain expertise.</li>
  <li> Gain and maintain familiarity with the complexities and interdependencies of deployed AI systems; terminology and concepts from disciplines outside of AI practice such as the law, sociology, psychology, public policy, and systems design and engineering.</li>
  <li>  Maintain awareness of industry and technical standards and appropriate legal standards.</li>
  <li> Track, document or inventory the organization's AI systems, including existing systems and third-party entities associated with AI systems.</li>
  <li> Gain and maintain awareness for how to scientifically evaulate claims about AI system performance and benefits before launching into system design and development to enable adherence to responsible practices.</li>
  <li> Define and document the task, purpose, minimum functionality, and benefits of the AI system, and consider whether the project is worth pursuing.</li>
  <li> Define the context of use, including operational environment; impacts to individuals, groups, communities, organizations, and society; user characteristics; task; and social environment; determine the user and organizational requirements, including business requirements, user requirements, and technical requirements.</li>
  <li> Identify human-AI interaction and/or roles, such as whether the application will support human decision making, replace a human, and make predictions; plan for risks related to these configurations; and document requirements, roles, and responsibilities for human oversight of deployed systems.</li>
  </ul>
