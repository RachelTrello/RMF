## <span style="color:black;font-weight:360;font-size:26px">Question</span>

Have the benefits of the system been articulated and assessed?

## <span style="color:black;font-weight:360;font-size:26px">How can my organization implement this sub-category?</span>

Incorporate stakeholder feedback to document perceived system benefits above the status quo and align with other stakeholder needs; consider inclusion of a more formal cost-benefit analysis in subsequent measurement stages of risk management. 

Perform context analysis related to timeframe, safety concerns, geographic area, physical environment, ecosystems, social environment, and cultural norms within which the expected benefits or negative impacts exist.

**Transparency Considerations – Key Questions: MAP 3.1** 
- Did you communicate the benefits of the AI system to users? 
- Did you provide appropriate training material and disclaimers to users on how to adequately use the AI system? 
- Did your organization implement a risk management system to address risks involved in deploying the identified AI solution (e.g. personnel risk or changes to commercial objectives)?

## <span style="color:black;font-weight:360;font-size:26px">What is this sub-category about?</span>

<!--more-->

AI systems have implicit and explicit costs, and inherent risks. Systems should present a benefit to counteract these costs and risks. To identify system benefits, organizations can define and document system purpose and utility, along with foreseeable costs, risks, and negative impacts. This information should include credible justification for anticipated benefits beyond the status quo.
