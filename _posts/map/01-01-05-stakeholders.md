Have the internal and external stakeholders been defined, and is there a plan to engage or allow for continuous engagement that will inform system design and maintenance?

## <span style="color:black;font-weight:360;font-size:26px">How can my organization implement this sub-category?</span>

Document the groups or individuals that comprise the system's internal and external stakeholders. 

Define and standardize mechansims by which AI design and development teams can interact with internal and external stakeholders to receive feedback on system design and implementation decisions. 

Ensure appropriate skills and practices exist in-house for carrying out stakeholder engagement activities, eliciting, capturing and synthesizing stakeholder feedback, and translating it for design and development teams. 

Define which AI actors - beyond AI design and development teams- will perform reviews of system design, implementation, and operation, and standard test, evaluation, verification, and validation practices.

**Transparency Considerations – Key Questions: MAP 1.5**
- To what extent has the entity clarified the roles, responsibilities, and delegated authorities to relevant stakeholders?
- Who is responsible for checking the AI at these intervals?
- What type of information is accessible on the design, operations, and limitations of the AI system to external stakeholders, including end users, consumers, regulators, and individuals impacted by use of the AI system?
- If anyone believed that the AI no longer meets this ethical framework, who will be responsible for receiving the concern and as appropriate investigating and remediating the issue? Do they have authority to modify, limit, or stop the use of the AI?
- How easily accessible and current is the information available to external stakeholders?
